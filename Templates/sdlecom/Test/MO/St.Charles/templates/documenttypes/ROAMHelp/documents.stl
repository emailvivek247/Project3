<B>Basic Search</B><P><UL><LI>
The Basic Search is a full text search across all indexed fields.  
<p>
Example:  If a user types <I>John Smith</I> into the Basic Search it will find all instances of <I>John Smith</I> located in all fields indexed.  The user would also get instances of <I>Smith John</I> that are located in all fields indexed.

</LI></UL>

<B>Advanced Search</B><P><UL><LI>
The Advanced Search is a full text field-level search that can be accessed from the <I>Advanced Search</I> hyperlink on the main search page.  The Advanced Search can be used to search by Instrument Number, Name, Date Recorded, individual Legal fields, and more!
<P>
Example: Select the <I>Advanced Search</I> hyperlink (shown below) 
<P><img src="templates/documenttypes/ROAMHelp/resource/ROAM_BasicSearch_Box.PNG" border="0" />

</LI></UL>



<B>Results Ranking</B><P><UL><LI>
ROAM ranks the entire search results by relevance first, and time recorded second.  If a user enters a search for <I>John Smith</I> in ROAM, records that contain an exact match of <I>John Smith</I> will be displayed first.  Records that contain the exact match within the exact field will be ranked by the date and time they were recorded in descending order.  Records that contain <I>Smith John</I> will be ranked after records that contain <I>John Smith</I>. 
</LI></UL>

<B>Results Sorting</B><P><UL><LI>
ROAM utilizes client side sorting table to display results.  A user can sort the results in the current page by double clicking on any of the column headers.  Please note that this sorts only the results within the current page.  
</LI></UL>


<B>Wild Card Searching</B><P><UL><LI>
ROAM supports Wildcard searching.  A user can perform a Wildcard search by entering a ‘*’ after a minimum of 2 characters in order to utilize wildcard searching capability.
<P>
Example:  Entering <I>Jo* Smith</I> in ROAM will return results matching <I>John Smith, Smith John, Joe Smith, Smith Joe, Joseph Smith, Smith Joseph, etc.</I> 
</LI></UL>

<B>Quotations in Searching</B><P><UL><LI>
When you put the quotes around multiple words, the system will treat it as a single expression and search for the text exactly in the order. 
<P>
Example:  Entering <I>"John S"</I> in ROAM will return results matching <I>John Smith, John Simpson, John Stalone-Jones, etc.</I>
</LI></UL>

<B>Faceting (Filter)</B><P><UL><LI>
ROAM provides the ability to filter searches utilizing ROAM’s faceting functionality.  The Facet is located on the left hand side of your search results screen.  When selecting an item in the facet it will filter your results to include only results that match that item.  Selected filters are shown at the top of the facet. Users have the option of removing filters by clicking on them again in the top of the facet.  
</LI></UL>

<B>Exact Searches</B><P><UL><LI>
Users can run an exact search in the Basic Search window by placing quotation marks (“ “) around the string of text they want to search on. This feature is not permitted in the Advanced Search Window
<P>
Example: Entering <I>“Smith John”</I> will return results matching <I>Smith John</I> and will not return results matching <I>John Smith</I>
</LI></UL>


<B>Results Per Page</B><P><UL><LI>
The results per page in ROAM can be adjusted by the user to any of the allowed settings in the results per page drop down located in the lower right hand corner of the web page. 
</LI></UL>


<B>Export Options</B><P><UL><LI>
ROAM allows the user to export the contents of the page into excel, pdf, and work using the Export feature located at the bottom of the search results
</LI></UL>

<B><A NAME = "DASH">Dashboards</A></B><P><UL><LI>
ROAM’s dashboards allow data to be represented graphical to provide better analysis.  Many of ROAM’s dashboards are interactive, meaning that selecting an item on a dashboard will update the dashboard, initialize another dashboard, or even run a search within ROAM.  In addition, some dashboards can be downloaded to PDF, JPEG, and PNG.

             	ROAM strives to utilize the latest in web technology, so we recommend our users take advantage of the most current versions of available web browsers like Internet Explorer(IE) 11, Chrome 31, Firefox 26, etc., to get the best ROAM experience possible.<br/><br/>
             	<b>Internet Explorer Browser Mode</b> and <b> Document Mode</b>:
             	Like other browsers, Internet Explorer(IE) supports Browser and Document Modes. These modes affect the way webpages are interpreted and displayed. IE allows you to choose between support for the latest standard or support for certain behaviors popularized by older browsers.<br/><br/>
             	As mentioned above, ROAM strives to bring users the latest in web technology and browser settings are a crucial part of displaying the ROAM web pages properly. Below is a quick walk through on how to check and change your IE browser and document mode settings which work best with ROAM.<br/><br/>
             	<ul>
             	    <li style="font-size:15px;">Once you've launched your IE browser, press the <b>F12</b> key on your keyboard. This will promp an action console to show at the bottom of the screen (Highlighted in green. See screen shot below). At the top of the console, there will be a menu bar with different menu options. From here, Browser Mode and Document Mode can be switched to support newer or older modes.<br/><br/>
             	    For the best ROAM experience, we recommend using the latest modes, <b>Browser Mode: IE11</b> and <b>Document Mode:IE11 standards</b>. To switch modes, simply hover over the menu item with your mouse and select the mode you wish to employ. Once selection has been made, press F12 to close the action console or click the "x" at the very right of the action console menu bar.

<B><A NAME = "FAQ"><FONT SIZE = "3">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</FONT></A></B>
<BR><BR><P>
<B><I>Why does it appear that some records duplicate?</I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM allows you to search on all records located in the index.  This means that the results grid includes all parties and all legal descriptions for a given record.  
</LI></UL>
<B><I>I clicked on a document type on ROAM's Timeline Statistics dashboard and it ran a search.  Why are the number of records returned different then the number of
records displayed on the dashboard?</I></B><UL><LI>
The ROAM dashboard displayed the total number of documents, however the ROAM search page is displaying all associated parties and legal descriptions for those selected documents. 
</LI></UL>
<B><I><A NAME = "PHONETIC">What is a Phonetic Search?</A></I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM's Phonetic Search uses advanced mathematical algorithms to search across names indexed within the system and return records 
where the name is pronounced like the name that is being searched on. The phonetic search will only apply these advanced algorithms 
to names in the index, and not to other fields.  Also, as a result of searching across the indexed names for results that 
are pronounced like the name being searched on, the phonetic search will bring back more results than a traditional exact name search.  
</LI></UL>
<B><I><A NAME = "CHROME">I can't print images in Google Chrome?</A></I></B><UL><LI>
Google Chrome now includes a default PDF Viewer, however this PDF Viewer does not include the ability to print PDFs.  Disabling the viewer 
will allow the ROAM PDF Viewer, which does allow printing PDFs, to be used by Chrome.  To disable the Chrome Default Viewer please 
follow the following steps:
<UL>
<LI>Type about:plugins in Chrome’s Address bar and press enter.</LI>
<LI>Click "Disable" for "Chrome PDF Viewer"</LI>
<LI>Shut down and restart your browser</LI>
</LI></UL>
