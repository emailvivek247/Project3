<B>Basic Search</B><P><UL><LI>
The Basic Search is a full text search across all indexed fields.  
<p>
Example:  If a user types <I>John Smith</I> into the Basic Search it will find all instances of <I>John Smith</I> located in all fields indexed.  The user would also get instances of <I>Smith John</I> that are located in all fields indexed.

</LI></UL>

<B>Advanced Search</B><P><UL><LI>
The Advanced Search is a full text field-level search that can be accessed from the <I>Advanced Search</I> hyperlink on the main search page.  The Advanced Search can be used to search by Instrument Number, Name, Date Recorded, individual Legal fields, and more!
<P>
Example: Select the <I>Advanced Search</I> hyperlink (shown below)

<b>Name Search Tips</b><p>

   <ul>
              <li>
         	    <b>Starts With Search</b> will return results that start with the search value provided by the user.
         	       <p>
         	         Example: If a user wants to search for the name <i>"SMITH J"</i> and selects the <b>Starts With</b> search option, the search will find records starting with the name <i>"SMITH J"</i>, such as <i>"SMITH JOHN"</i> or <i>"SMITH JAMES"</i>.
      	</li>
      	<li>
                  <b>Contains Search</b> will return results which contain the search value provided by the user.
      	       <p>
      		 Example: If a user wants to search for the name <i>"BANK J"</i> and selects the <b>Contains</b> search option, the search will find records that contain the search value <i>"BANK J"</i>, such a <i>"SMITH-BANK JAMES"</i> or <i>"SMITHBANK ROBERT JAMES"</i>.
      	</li>
      	<li>
      	    <b>Exact Search</b> will return the exact match of what the user is searching for.
      	       <p>
      	         Example: If a user wants to search for the number <i>"4"</i> and selects the <b>Exact</b> search option, the search will find the exact match for records containing the number <i>"4"</i>. If the value <i>4</i> is part of a phrase or another number, i.e.<i> 504, 410, 444</i>, it will not return in the results set.
      	</li>
      	<li>
      	<b>Phonetic Search</b> will return all results that phonetically sound like what the user searched. 
      	<p>
      	Example: If a user searches for the name <i>"KELLY"</i> and selects the <b>Phonetic</b> search option, the search results returned will have a similar sound to the search value entered while they may not be spelled similarly, such as <i>"KELLI"</i> or <i>"CALI"</i>.
      	</li>
      
   </ul>

<B><A NAME = "FAQ"><FONT SIZE = "3">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</FONT></A></B>
<BR><BR><P>
<B><I>Why does it appear that some records duplicate?</I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM allows you to search on all records located in the index.  This means that the results grid includes all parties and all legal descriptions for a given record.  
</LI></UL>
<B><I>I clicked on a document type on ROAM's Timeline Statistics dashboard and it ran a search.  Why are the number of records returned different then the number of
records displayed on the dashboard?</I></B><UL><LI>
The ROAM dashboard displayed the total number of documents, however the ROAM search page is displaying all associated parties and legal descriptions for those selected documents. 
</LI></UL>
<B><I><A NAME = "PHONETIC">What is a Phonetic Search?</A></I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM's Phonetic Search uses advanced mathematical algorithms to search across names indexed within the system and return records 
where the name is pronounced like the name that is being searched on. The phonetic search will only apply these advanced algorithms 
to names in the index, and not to other fields.  Also, as a result of searching across the indexed names for results that 
are pronounced like the name being searched on, the phonetic search will bring back more results than a traditional exact name search.

	<LI><b>RETURN DOCUMENTS</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="redText">Posted Date: November 22, 2010</span></BR>
	When providing a return envelope for recorded documents it would be appreciated if you would PLEASE INCLUDE POSTAGE and USE A SIZE APPROPRIATE ENVELOPE
	for multiple or thick documents. Thanks.
	</LI>
	<LI><b>ATTORNEY NAME and BAR NUMBER on DEEDS</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="redText">Posted Date: April 26, 2013</span></BR>
	In an effort to reduce errors in deeds that are recorded in the Arlington County Circuit Court, beginning May 1, 2013, the Clerk of the Circuit Court will
	require that all deeds conveying not more than four residential units state on the first page of the document that it was prepared either by the owner of the real property or by an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth of Virginia, consistent with Section 17.1-223 of the Code of Virginia. The attorney statement must include both the attorney’s name and Virginia State Bar number. The Clerk’s Office will presume that a deed does not convey more than four residential units unless the first page of the document so states, or other evidence is presented to the Clerk’s Office that demonstrates otherwise. Please Note: Deeds of Trust do not fall within the type of "deed" referenced in Section 17.1-223 and, therefore, are not subject to the requirement described above. Please contact the Circuit Court Clerk’s Office at 703.228.4369 with any questions.
	</LI>
	<LI><b>REGIONAL CONGESTION RELIEF FEE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="redText">Posted Date: June 10, 2013</span></BR>
	Beginning July 1, 2013, the Arlington Circuit Court Clerk’s Office will collect the "Regional Congestion Relief Fee" required by Va. Code
	Section 58.1-802.2. The fee applies to "each deed, instrument, or writing by which lands, tenements, or other realty…is sold and is granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to or vested in the purchaser or any other person, by such purchaser’s direction," the same types of documents that are subject to the State Grantor’s Tax under Va. Code Section 58.1-802. The rate of the Regional Congestion Relief Fee "when the consideration or value of the interest, whichever is greater, equals or exceeds $100, shall be $0.15 for each $100 or fraction thereof, exclusive of the value of any lien or encumbrance remaining thereon at the time of the sale, whether such lien is assumed or the realty sold subject to such lien or encumbrance." The Regional Congestion Relief Fee will be collected on documents that are recorded on or after July 1, 2013, regardless of when the documents were submitted for recordation. Please plan accordingly when submitting documents around July 1. Please contact the Circuit Court Clerk’s Office at 703.228.4369 with any questions.

	<LI><b>CERTIFIED COPIES OFFERED for RE-RECORDING</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="redText">Posted Date: June 10, 2013</span></BR>
	Effective immediately, the Arlington Circuit Court Clerk’s Office will not accept for re-recording a certified copy of any deed or other document
	that was previously recorded in the Arlington Circuit Court. Please note that the policy stated above does not affect the right to admit to record a certified copy of a document admitted to record in a clerk’s office located in a different jurisdiction, provided that the requirements set forth in Va. Code Section 55-109 are met. Please contact the Circuit Court Clerk’s Office at 703.228.4369 with any questions.
	</LI>
	<LI><b>DEED OF TRUST MODIFICATIONS</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="redText">Posted Date: September 19, 2013</span></BR>
	This notice is intended to clarify how recordation tax on deed of trust modifications is determined. Pursuant to Va. Code Section 58.1-803.C, an instrument
	modifying a deed of trust shall certify the amount of the existing debt. Recordation tax is due on the difference, if any, between the existing debt and the amount secured by the instrument modifying the deed of trust. Please contact the Circuit Court Clerk’s Office at 703.228.4369 with any questions.
	</LI>
	<LI><b>DEED OF TRUST - DEBT IN EXCESS OF FMV OF PROPERTY</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="redText">Posted Date: January 10, 2014</span></BR>
	Pursuant to Va. Code §58.1-803(A), in the case of any deed of trust in which the obligations described are not fully secured because they exceed the fair
	market value of the property conveyed, the recording tax shall be paid on the fair market value of the property conveyed rather than the amount of the debt. For example, if a deed of trust is in the amount of $100,000, but the property being encumbered is valued at $85,000. The tax is based on the value of the property - $85,000. Please contact the Circuit Court Clerk’s Office at 703.228.4369 with any questions.
