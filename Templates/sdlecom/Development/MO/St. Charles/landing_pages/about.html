						<i>Recorder of Deeds, St. Charles County Missouri</i>

						<br/><br/>
						<p id="bio">
                                Began working in the St. Charles County Recorder's Office 1 June 1984. First ran for the position of Recorder in 1986 (her predecessor was retiring).
								Her successful campaign platform was to modernize and bring the office into the 20th century! The only automation in use at that time was a custom written land records indexing program from 1972!
								She was elected and took office on 1 January 1987.  She immediately embarked on an extensive mission to automate and streamline all operations of the office.  She sat with a contract programmer to create numerous custom applications for recording and indexing a variety of records.  She made critical workflow and customer service improvements which ultimately saved the office through the ensuing 'boom' years when document recording multiplied exponentially!
								During these years, Ms. Hall joined and availed herself of the expertise and knowledge available through various professional organizations including Recorder's Association of Missouri (RAM), International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials and Treasurers (IACREOT) and Property Records Industry Association (PRIA).  Through networking and attending these training conferences and trade shows, she was able to learn about issues and trends taking place across the United States and to become familiar with technological advances as they were being developed.
								Through all of this, Ms. Hall has made every effort to continue to keep her office on the cutting edge of technology to the benefit of both her staff and patrons. This has included beginning the optical imaging of documents in January 1994 and then implementation of Granicus' full suite of applications to integrate all functions of the office into one, highly sophisticated software system.  This decision lead to seamless additions of such customer service products as internet searching and printing as well as electronic document recording.
								So, when Granicus introduced Ms. Hall to their Google style search product, ROAM (Rapid Online Access Method), she knew this was the next step to improve and update public access to her office's records.
								According to Ms. Hall, "After twenty-seven years of modernization and technological improvements to the storage and retrieval of the millions of documents in my care, ROAM is the perfect 'next step' for the benefit of my constituents.  I am excited to offer this improved online search method for our citizens and professional researchers."
