Example:  If a user types <I>John Smith</I> into the Basic Search it will find all instances of <I>John Smith</I> located in all fields indexed.  The user would also get instances of <I>Smith John</I> that are located in all fields indexed.

<b>Name Search Tips</b><p>

   <ul>
              <li>
         	    <b>Starts With Search</b> will return results that start with the search value provided by the user.
         	       <p>
         	         Example: If a user wants to search for the name <i>"SMITH J"</i> and selects the <b>Starts With</b> search option, the search will find records starting with the name <i>"SMITH J"</i>, such as <i>"SMITH JOHN"</i> or <i>"SMITH JAMES"</i>.
      	</li>
      	<li>
                  <b>Contains Search</b> will return results which contain the search value provided by the user.
      	       <p>
      		 Example: If a user wants to search for the name <i>"BANK J"</i> and selects the <b>Contains</b> search option, the search will find records that contain the search value <i>"BANK J"</i>, such a <i>"SMITH-BANK JAMES"</i> or <i>"SMITHBANK ROBERT JAMES"</i>.
      	</li>
      	<li>
      	    <b>Exact Search</b> will return the exact match of what the user is searching for.
      	       <p>
      	         Example: If a user wants to search for the number <i>"4"</i> and selects the <b>Exact</b> search option, the search will find the exact match for records containing the number <i>"4"</i>. If the value <i>4</i> is part of a phrase or another number, i.e.<i> 504, 410, 444</i>, it will not return in the results set.
      	</li>
      	<li>
      	<b>Phonetic Search</b> will return all results that phonetically sound like what the user searched. 
      	<p>
      	Example: If a user searches for the name <i>"KELLY"</i> and selects the <b>Phonetic</b> search option, the search results returned will have a similar sound to the search value entered while they may not be spelled similarly, such as <i>"KELLI"</i> or <i>"CALI"</i>.
      	</li>
      
   </ul>

<B><A NAME = "FAQ"><FONT SIZE = "3">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</FONT></A></B>
<BR><BR><P>
<B><I>Why does it appear that some records duplicate?</I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM allows you to search on all records located in the index.  This means that the results grid includes all parties and all legal descriptions for a given record.  
</LI></UL>
<B><I>I clicked on a document type on ROAM's Timeline Statistics dashboard and it ran a search.  Why are the number of records returned different then the number of
records displayed on the dashboard?</I></B><UL><LI>
The ROAM dashboard displayed the total number of documents, however the ROAM search page is displaying all associated parties and legal descriptions for those selected documents. 
</LI></UL>
<B><I><A NAME = "PHONETIC">What is a Phonetic Search?</A></I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM's Phonetic Search uses advanced mathematical algorithms to search across names indexed within the system and return records 
where the name is pronounced like the name that is being searched on. The phonetic search will only apply these advanced algorithms 
to names in the index, and not to other fields.  Also, as a result of searching across the indexed names for results that 
are pronounced like the name being searched on, the phonetic search will bring back more results than a traditional exact name search.
