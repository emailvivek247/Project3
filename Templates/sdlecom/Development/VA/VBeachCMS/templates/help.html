             	ROAM strives to utilize the latest in web technology, so we recommend our users take advantage of the most current versions of available web browsers like Internet Explorer(IE) 11, Chrome 31, Firefox 26, etc., to get the best ROAM experience possible.<br/><br/>
             	<b>Internet Explorer Browser Mode</b> and <b> Document Mode</b>:
             	Like other browsers, Internet Explorer(IE) supports Browser and Document Modes. These modes affect the way webpages are interpreted and displayed. IE allows you to choose between support for the latest standard or support for certain behaviors popularized by older browsers.<br/><br/>
             	As mentioned above, ROAM strives to bring users the latest in web technology and browser settings are a crucial part of displaying the ROAM web pages properly. Below is a quick walk through on how to check and change your IE browser and document mode settings which work best with ROAM.<br/><br/>
             	<ul>
             	    <li style="font-size:15px;">Once you've launched your IE browser, press the <b>F12</b> key on your keyboard. This will promp an action console to show at the bottom of the screen (Highlighted in green. See screen shot below). At the top of the console, there will be a menu bar with different menu options. From here, Browser Mode and Document Mode can be switched to support newer or older modes.<br/><br/>
             	    For the best ROAM experience, we recommend using the latest modes, <b>Browser Mode: IE11</b> and <b>Document Mode:IE11 standards</b>. To switch modes, simply hover over the menu item with your mouse and select the mode you wish to employ. Once selection has been made, press F12 to close the action console or click the "x" at the very right of the action console menu bar.

<B><I>Why am I receiving a "Nothing found to display" message after doing a search?</I></B><UL><LI>
This message will display if there are no results to display which match the criteria entered or if you have not entered any criteria to search on. Only cases which were filed after July 31, 2009 will be returned in the search results. Please go to <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/">http://www.courts.state.va.us/</a> to locate any cases filed prior to July 31, 2009.
</LI></UL>

<B><I><A NAME = "FORMAT">How can I search by case number?</A></I></B><UL><LI>
Case number format includes a two character court type prefix followed by eight digits and a hyphen (-) with a two digit suffix. If the case number you are searching does not contain eight digits before the hyphen, try typing two zeroes after the first two digits. For example, if your case number is CL09-1234, try CL09001234-00. Please note that the two digit suffix does not indicate charge count. The suffix is used when subsequent filings are made under the base case such as Reinstatements.
</LI></UL>

<B><I>How can I search by date in the Basic Search?</I></B><UL><LI>
To search by a date in the Basic Search, the date must be in the following format: YYYYMMDD. For example, 20091231 would search for date December 31, 2009.
</LI></UL>
