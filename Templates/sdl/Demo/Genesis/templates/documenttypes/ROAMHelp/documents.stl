<A NAME = "NAMETIPS"><b>Name Search Tips</b></A>

   <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Starts With</b> - The <b>Starts With</b> search option allows users to search on records with names that <b>start with</b> the specified value. <br/><br/>
            Example: Searching for <i>"Smith M"</i> in Starts With search mode, will return records that only start with <i>"Smith M"</i> such as <i>"Smith, Maria"</i>, <i>"Smith, Michael"<i/>, <i>"Smith, Michelle"<i/>, etc. The results set will NOT return records with names like <i>"Michael Smith"</i> or <i>"Michelle Smith"</i>. Eventhough the names are the same, they do not start with "Smith M".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p><b>Contains</b> - The <b>Contains</b> search option allows users to search on records which <b>contain</b> the specified value. This is the most flexible way of searching.<br/><br/>
	    Example: Searching for <i>"BANK J"</i> in Contains search mode, will return records that contain <i>"BANK J"</i> such as <i>"SMITH-BANK JAMES"</i>, <i>"SMITHBANK ROBERT JAMES"<i/>, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
	    <p><b>Exact</b> - The <b>Exact</b> search option allows users to search on records that <b>exactly match</b> the specified value.<i> **Please note that spaces count as part of the search value. If there is an extra space in your search value or an extra space is part of the results set, a match will not return.**</i><br/><br/>
	    Example: Searching for the number <i>"4"</i> in Exact search mode, will return records that directly match the number <i>"4"</i>. If the value <i>4</i> is part of a phrase or another number, i.e. <i>"504"</i>, <i>"410"</i>, <i>"444"</i>, <i>"404 Willow Drive"</i>, it will not return in the results set.</p>
        </li>
   </ul>
   
<br>
<b>Search Tips</b><p>

   <ul>
        <li>
            <b>AND | OR Search Option</b> will return results according the search value provided by the user.
            <p><b>AND</b> is the more practical method of searching. Selecting this option will allow the user to search for multiple, consecutive words within fields and will limit the results displayed.</p>
            <p>Example selecting <b>AND</b>: If the user wants to search for the name <i>"SMITH"</i> and selects <b>AND</b> Case Type: <i>"DIVORCE"</i>, the search will find <i>"DIVORCE"</i> records that contains the name <i>"SMITH"</i>.
            <p><b>OR</b> is a versatile search method of searching. 
            <p>Example selecting <b>OR</b>: If a user wants to search for the name <i>"SMITH J"</i> and selects <b>OR</b> Case Type: <i>"DIVORCE"</i>, the result search will be much more varied finding any record that contains the words<i>"SMITH"</i> <b>OR</b> <i>"DIVORCE"</i>.
        </li>
   </ul>


<B>Results Sorting</B><P><UL><LI>

             	ROAM strives to utilize the latest in web technology, so we recommend our users take advantage of the most current versions of available web browsers like Internet Explorer(IE) 9, Chrome 25, Firefox 19, etc., to get the best ROAM experience possible.<br/><br/>
             	<b>Internet Explorer Browser Mode</b> and <b> Document Mode</b>:
             	Like other browsers, Internet Explorer(IE) supports Browser and Document Modes. These modes affect the way webpages are interpreted and displayed. IE allows you to choose between support for the latest standard or support for certain behaviors popularized by older browsers.<br/><br/>
             	As mentioned above, ROAM strives to bring users the latest in web technology and browser settings are a crucial part of displaying the ROAM web pages properly. Below is a quick walk through on how to check and change your IE browser and document mode settings which work best with ROAM.<br/><br/>
             	<ul>
             	    <li style="font-size:15px;">Once you've launched your IE browser, press the <b>F12</b> key on your keyboard. This will promp an action console to show at the bottom of the screen (Highlighted in green. See screen shot below). At the top of the console, there will be a menu bar with different menu options. From here, Browser Mode and Document Mode can be switched to support newer or older modes.<br/><br/>
             	    For the best ROAM experience, we recommend using the latest modes, <b>Browser Mode: IE9</b> and <b>Document Mode:IE9 standards</b>. To switch modes, simply hover over the menu item with your mouse and select the mode you wish to employ. Once selection has been made, press F12 to close the action console or click the "x" at the very right of the action console menu bar.

<BR><BR><P>
<B><I>Why does it appear that some records duplicate?</I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM allows you to search on all records located in the index.  This means that the results grid includes all parties and all case information for a given record.  
</LI></UL>
<B><I><A NAME = "PHONETIC">What is a Phonetic Search?</A></I></B><UL><LI>
ROAM's Phonetic Search uses advanced mathematical algorithms to search across names indexed within the system and return records 
where the name is pronounced like the name that is being searched on. The phonetic search will only apply these advanced algorithms 
to names in the index, and not to other fields.  Also, as a result of searching across the indexed names for results that 
are pronounced like the name being searched on, the phonetic search will bring back more results than a traditional exact name search.
